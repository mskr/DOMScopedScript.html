<!--
	This file demonstrates a way of webpage scripting, that was found good by me.
	The idea is to define functions on the Node class, which is contained in DOM implementations since ancient times.
	
	Functions can be called from HTML directly, enabling you to annotate your webpage content with interactions.
	The script that implements the interaction can access the data stored in the node.
	This kind of direct binding eliminates the need to copy and synchronize data (like Angular and React do).
	Also pollution of the global scope is prevented.
	While this works, the more modern approach of doing this are WebComponents,
	which let you define your own HTML tags, that can be completely new
	or inherited from existing tags.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
	<script>
		Node.prototype.myfunc = function() { console.log('I am scoped to a Node object') }
	</script>
</head>
<body>
<div onclick="this.myfunc()">Hallo Welt</div>
</body>
